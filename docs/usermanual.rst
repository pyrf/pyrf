   python setup.py install


PyRF API for ThinkRF RTSA Products
-----------------------

:class:`pyrf.devices.thinkrf.WSA` is the class that provides access
to ThinkRF RTSA devices.
Its methods closely match the SCPI Command Set described in the
Programmers Reference available in
`ThinkRF Resources <http://www.thinkrf.com/resources>`_.

There are simple examples illustrating usage of this API under the "examples"
directory included with the source code.

This API may be used in a blocking mode (the default) or in an asynchronous
mode with using the `Twisted`_ python library.

In blocking mode, all methods that read from the device will wait
to receive a response before returning.

In asynchronous mode, all methods will send their commands to the device and
then immediately return a Twisted Deferred object.  If you need to wait for
the response or completion of this command, you can attach a callback to the
Deferred object and the Twisted reactor will call it when ready.  You may
choose to use Twisted's inlineCallbacks function decorator to write Twisted
code that resembles synchronous code by yielding the Deferred objects
returned from the API.

To use the asynchronous, when a WSA instance is created,
you must pass a :class:`pyrf.connectors.twisted_async.TwistedConnector`
instance as the connector parameter, as shown in :ref:`twisted-show-i-q`
